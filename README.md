# memoryhog
its a (hopefully portable) program that takes a lot of memory

it keeps the memory for itself until you tell him to stop (press enter) or kill it

## how to compile :
```
$ cc main.c -o memoryhog
```

## how to use :
i want to waste 4GB of ram

either :
```
$ ./memoryhog 4000000000
```
or
```
$ ./memoryhog
how much memory can i eat ?
4000000000
```
(suffixes will be supported later this century)
